Suppose total budget is 37933.33 for 19 days

Daily Allowance = (Total Budget - Total Spent) / Days Remaining

Day 1:
- Daily Allowance = 37933.33 / 19 = 1996.49
- After transactions: 1996.49 - 500 - 150 + 200 = 1546.49
- Remaining for day 1: 1546.49

Day 2 (midnight rollover):
- Total Spent still = 450 (net from day 1)
- Days Remaining = 18
- Daily Allowance = (37933.33 - 450) / 18 = 2082.41
- This is the new daily limit!
